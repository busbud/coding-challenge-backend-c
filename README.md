# Busbud Coding Challenge [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/sataz/coding-challenge-backend-c/tree/feature%2Fsuggestion-api.png?circle-token=0e5fe529dd2e8b395a38b24741e3c0041db1056c)](https://circleci.com/gh/sataz/coding-challenge-backend-c)

## ES POC

I wanted to see if ES could help us achieve our goal, in a more production-ready way, and with shorter response time.

So I created some scripts to import data into ES.
I used Bonsai on heroky (free for 10,000 documents).

I didn't get a chance to finish this Proof of concept because of lack of time.


### What is left

Build the right query!

I found a way to combine query using AND condition (with MUST),
which would allow '"name is close to Mtl"' AND coord in a range of 200km'
but I didn't find a way yet to change the score based on "geo proximity".


------------------

## Implementation

Here are some details about my implementation:

* it is na√Øve implementation: the tsv file is loaded once, processed, and necessary data are kept in memory
* I used levenshtein score to calculate the distance between 2 words. I had to invert/convert that score to fit the requirement (score between 0 and 1) and some weird results when the query length was a lot smaller than the city name (ex. "Mtl" score for "Montreal" was really low...). The score adjustment is based on basic Maths rules (increase the score if query length is smaller than city name...) and it is empirical.
* for distance score, I used basic Maths and decided to use the square root function because of its curve that corresponds to what I had in mind (boost the score when close...).
* the score combination (text and distance) is also empirical. I decided to give more weight to the text (0.7 vs 0.3) because the user.
* for distance calculation, I chose a simple method because:
    * it's faster,
    * the score is more impacted by the distance when the distance is small, and the simplified method is good enough for small distance

# Modules

THey can be find in lib:

* location-parser: uses node stream to process the tsv and return a list of locations.
* location: a class that represent a city, that contains a name, state, country and a geoPoint
* geo-point: represent a latitude/longitude pair (a coordinate).
* query: repesent a query that a user can type: a text and eventually a geoPoint.
* score: helper function that centralize the text and distance calculation.
* store: memory store that knows how to find suggestions from the list of locations.
* errors: some errors that are used by the previous modules.

## Tests

47 tests, mostly unit tests. But I added some `suggestions` tests (refactored only, except from the /montreal/i issue
 - see below).


## Modifications

* removed 127.0.0.1 from app.js to make it work on heroku
* fixed one test because a string does not support `test` method
* I limited the suggestions to 5 by default (was not specified I think)
* I allow a `limit` param to change the default limit of 5
* I allow a `theeshold` param to change the default theeshold of 0.15 (not suggested if score is below 0.15)


## Performance

I used jmeter against http heroku (1 dyno). I am new to it, so I hope that I interpreted the results correctly. with 50 users, ramp-up of 5s, loop count of 20:

- with just the q parameter ("Mtl"): I get 5762 requests/s (253ms average)
- with q parameter and lat/long: I get 4594 requests/s (average 390ms)


## Possible Improvements and other considerations

* use Elasticsearch (fuzzy + geo-point). I am not sure how to bring back the ES score to a 0-1 range directly in ES. Score and threeshold in ES seems hard for a beginer. MongoDB?
* add a api version, in the URL or the header (defaults to latest)

## Resources

* [heroku app](https://sleepy-ridge-3726.herokuapp.com/suggestions?q=mtrl&latitude=45.5&longitude=-73.5)
* [github repo](https://github.com/sataz/coding-challenge-backend-c). Not that I used temporary github account for this challenge


-------------------------------------

## Requirements

Design an API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities.
The suggestions should be restricted to cities in the USA and Canada with a population above 5000 people.

- the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
- the caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    - each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    - each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
- all functional tests should pass (additional tests may be implemented as necessary).
- the final application should be [deployed to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).
- feel free to add more features if you like!

#### Sample responses

These responses are meant to provide guidance. The exact values can vary based on the data source and scoring algorithm

**Near match**

    GET /suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "London, ON, Canada",
      "latitude": "42.98339",
      "longitude": "-81.23304",
      "score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "name": "London, OH, USA",
      "latitude": "39.88645",
      "longitude": "-83.44825",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "London, KY, USA",
      "latitude": "37.12898",
      "longitude": "-84.08326",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "Londontowne, MD, USA",
      "latitude": "38.93345",
      "longitude": "-76.54941",
      "score": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
```

**No match**

    GET /suggestions?q=SomeRandomCityInTheMiddleOfNowhere

```json
{
  "suggestions": []
}
```


### Non-functional

- All code should be written in Javascript
- Mitigations to handle high levels of traffic should be implemented
- Work should be submitted as a pull-request to this repo
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus

## Getting Started

Begin by forking this repo and cloning your fork. GitHub has apps for [Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and
[Windows](http://windows.github.com/) that make this easier.

### Setting up a Nodejs environment

Get started by installing [nodejs](http://www.nodejs.org).

For OS X users, use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and `brew install nvm`

Once that's done, from the project directory, run

```
nvm use
```

### Setting up the project

In the project directory run

```
npm install
```

### Running the tests

The test suite can be run with

```
npm test
```

### Starting the application

To start a local server run

```
PORT=3456 npm start
```

which should produce output similar to

```
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:2345/suggestions
```
