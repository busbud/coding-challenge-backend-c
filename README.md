## Configuration ðŸŽ‰

* Everything is configurable at `app/config/config.json`.
* PM2 configuration are in `process.config.js`.

  }
}
```

## Searching Algorithm 

* An optimized implementation for the `Trie` DataStructure (Check `app/helpers/trie.js`).
* Support for `fuzziness` and storing objects instead of just words by specifying a specific key of the objects as lookup word.
* Calculate the `EditDistance`.
* Tolerance with mssing or extra letters.
* Interesting implementation in term of compile optimization.
* Insert the cities sorted in descending order by population to enhance the prefix expaning.
* Create the `Trie` at the first request and use it for future requests.
* Normalize the keys and the search qurey:
  * Lowercase.
  * Remove any characters that are not either a letter or space.
  * Remove duplicate sapces.
  * Remove prefix and suffix white spaces.
* Configurable (Check `app/config/config.json`:
  * **fuzziness**: the maximum edit distance.
  * **prefixLength**: the number of initial letters which will not be `fuzzified` to reduce the number of examined keys.
  * **maxResults**: the max number of returned results.

## Scoring

### General Notes

* Configurable weigts (Check `app/config/config.json`).
* Give a full score for the not applied criterias.
* If one of the criterias is set to 0, it will not be applied.

### Scoring criterias: 

#### population

* Give the full population score to the highest population city, otherwise give a partial score relatively to the highest population.

#### prefixUniqueness:

* Give the full prefixUniqueness score if the key is a unique prefix among all other cities' keys prefixes.

#### lengthMatching:
* Give the full lengthMatching score to the exact length matching, otherwise give a partial score relatively to the length difference.

#### editDistance:

* Give the full editDistance score when editDistance = 0, otherwise give a partial score relatively to the editDistance.
* It doesn't apply if the fuzziness matching option is set to 0.

#### geoDistance

* Give the full geoDistance score to the nearest city, otherwise give a partial score relatively to the distance.
* It doesn't apply if the user's geo location is not passed or if we have just one suggestion.

## Cool Things ðŸ˜€

* DI module.
* Router module.
* API versioning.
* Core modules loading desing pattern `load()`.
* The `require()` is only allowed in `app.js` check the comment in `app.js`.
* Params Schema (Check `app/config/config.json`).
* Trie implementation with fuzziness.
* More types of middlewares (before, service, controller, after, fail).
* Fully documented code, have fun reading the code :).
* Separate the validation from the logic the validation from module.
* Run a cluster of the app via PM2, configured in `app/config/config.json`.
* More unit testing cases (total 71).

## Bad Things ðŸ˜“

* I wrapped the response with `{meta: {}, data: {HERE}}`. In real world we should not break the API unless we agreed on this. I did it this time to allow you to have a look to my framework.
* I used the minimal parts of a framework that I built from around 3 years. Some parts of the code read a revamp since they have bad implementation, consistency, naming, documentation like `router.js`, `response.js`, `tasks.js`, `helpers/validate.js`, etc.

# Getting Started

## Setting up the project

In the project directory run

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

The test suite can be run with

```
npm test
```

## Starting the application

This project runs via PM2 as cluster, you can configure
the number of cluster in the `app/config/config.json` file

```
npm start
```
