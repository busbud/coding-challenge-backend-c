## Comments

### Stage 1: simple indexOf with coordinate distance.

First of all prepare data at first start of the service and store it in memory (~ 1.5 mb)
Base on query we filter cities, than caclucate distance between cities and sort.

##### Tests:
```
ab -n1000 -c5 http://127.0.0.1:2345/suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

Requests per second:    1220.62 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       4.096 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.819 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)


ab -n10000 -c20 'http://127.0.0.1:2345/suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163'

Requests per second:    1639.61 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       12.198 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.610 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
```

### Stage 1: levinstein distance with coordinate distance.


## Requirements


Design an API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities.
The suggestions should be restricted to cities in the USA and Canada with a population above 5000 people.

- the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
- the caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    - each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    - each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
- all functional tests should pass (additional tests may be implemented as necessary).
- the final application should be [deployed to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).
- feel free to add more features if you like!

#### Sample responses

These responses are meant to provide guidance. The exact values can vary based on the data source and scoring algorithm

**Near match**

    GET /suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "London, ON, Canada",
      "latitude": "42.98339",
      "longitude": "-81.23304",
      "score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "name": "London, OH, USA",
      "latitude": "39.88645",
      "longitude": "-83.44825",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "London, KY, USA",
      "latitude": "37.12898",
      "longitude": "-84.08326",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "Londontowne, MD, USA",
      "latitude": "38.93345",
      "longitude": "-76.54941",
      "score": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
```

**No match**

    GET /suggestions?q=SomeRandomCityInTheMiddleOfNowhere

```json
{
  "suggestions": []
}
```


### Non-functional

- All code should be written in Javascript
- Mitigations to handle high levels of traffic should be implemented
- Challenge is submitted as pull request against this repo ([fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)).
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus

## Getting Started

Begin by forking this repo and cloning your fork. GitHub has apps for [Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and
[Windows](http://windows.github.com/) that make this easier.

### Setting up a Nodejs environment

Get started by installing [nodejs](http://www.nodejs.org).

For OS X users, use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and `brew install nvm`

Once that's done, from the project directory, run

```
nvm use
```

### Setting up the project

In the project directory run

```
npm install
```

### Running the tests

The test suite can be run with

```
npm test
```

### Starting the application

To start a local server run

```
PORT=3456 npm start
```

which should produce output similar to

```
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3456/suggestions
```
