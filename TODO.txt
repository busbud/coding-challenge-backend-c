### Mandatory

x the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
x the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
x the caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    x the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    x each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    x each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    x each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
- all functional tests should pass (additional tests may be implemented as necessary).
    x fix test suggestions.js
- the final application should be [deployed to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).
- add documentation
- feel free to add more features if you like!

### Functional

- setup the api to determine what is a valid query:
    x return the correct code (can express take care of this?)
- read from the respective zip file (it seems this is already done in cities_canada-usa.tsv):
    x open the zip file only once and store it somewhere in the cache to prevent recalling.
    x parse through the right path (get to the critical path) and create a new file with the right cities and only
      the necessary information.
    x validate the new file exist and output its contents?!
- search through the new file with the city name only (elasticsearch?):
    x find a search engine that allows you to parse through the new file.
    - #based-on-information-about-the-engine:
        x search for the full name first
        x search for partial name
        x build an array of all possible suggestions. make sure its JSON formatted.
    - show query results in the browser
        x only show the needed json parts
        x move the ranking of index into api
- search through the array of suggestions based of coordinates:
    - enabled geolocation from browser.
    x send this through the query if enabled, if not send nothing (function is always on).
- create ui to search through a search box.
    - enable autosuggestion in the search box
    - show the results below the box
    - show province in results

### Non-functional

- All code should be written in Javascript
- Mitigations to handle high levels of traffic should be implemented
- Work should be submitted as a pull-request to this repo
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus

EXTRA:

- add ui
